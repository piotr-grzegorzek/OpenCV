# OpenCV Practical Examples

This project contains practical examples of using OpenCV to detect and label geometric shapes in images.

## Project Structure

- [`task1.py`](./task1.py): Contains code for detecting and labeling geometric shapes in an image.
- [`task2.py`](./task2.py): Contains code for recognition of ride/stop signals for trams.
- [`task3.py`](./task3.py): Contains code for generating and displaying two types of fractal images: the Sierpinski Triangle and the Sierpinski Carpet.
- [`utils.py`](./utils.py): Contains utility functions used across the project.

## Usage

Each script can be run independently. For example, to run the `task1.py` script, use the following command:

```sh
python task1.py
```

## Requirements

This project requires Python and OpenCV. The required Python packages can be installed using pip:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
